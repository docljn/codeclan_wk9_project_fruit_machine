# Java and Android Project
## Fruit Machine - Java with Android extension

Goal: Create a fruit machine in Java.

You have been asked to create a simple piece of software that will operate a fruit machine.

Your FruitMachine class should be well tested, and should have a spin() method that returns an integer value - the amount of winnings from the Symbol's value, if three identical symbols are spun.

If three identical symbols aren't spun, you should return 0.

### MVP
The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. For example, if the user spins and lands 3 matching symbols a winning message is displayed and their winnings updated and stored. Users should also be allowed to nudge and hold at random times.

### Project Extensions

* Allow users to choose from Symbol Packs (Different games.)
* Extend to 5 reels
* Turn into an Android app.


## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
